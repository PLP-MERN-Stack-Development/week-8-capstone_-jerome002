## Restaurant Management System â€“ MERN Stack Capstone Project

##  Project Overview

This is a **comprehensive full-stack MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js)** application built to demonstrate proficiency in full-stack development. The project serves as a restaurant management system, enabling restaurant staff to manage menus, inventory, orders, staff authentication, and real-time updates.


## Features

- Staff Registration and Login with JWT Authentication
- Menu Management (Add, Update, Delete Items)
- Order Management
- Real-time Dashboard with Inventory Tracking
- Role-Based Access Control
- Real-time Notifications (via Socket.IO)
-  PDF Invoice/Report Export (optional)
- Responsive Frontend with React & Bootstrap

## Tasks Completed

### Task 1: Project Planning and Design
- Chose a real-world problem: restaurant order and inventory management
- Wireframes and mockups created with Figma
-  MongoDB schema design with Mongoose validation
-  API endpoints planned using REST conventions
-  Roadmap documented in GitHub Projects
-  Technical architecture defined

###  Task 2: Backend Development
-  MongoDB with Mongoose schemas (User, MenuItem, Order)
- RESTful API with Express.js
-  JWT-based authentication with Bcrypt password hashing
-  Middleware for authentication, logging, and validation
-  Real-time order update tracking with Socket.IO
-  Basic unit and integration tests with Jest and Supertest

###  Task 3: Frontend Development
- Responsive UI using React.js and Tailwind/Bootstrap
-  Client-side routing with React Router DOM
-  Reusable components with props and hooks
-  Data fetching via Axios from backend
-  Form validation using custom logic and libraries like Yup
- Real-time updates displayed in order dashboard

###  Task 4: Testing and QA
- Unit tests for backend and critical frontend logic
-  Integration tests for API routes
-  Manual testing across major browsers and devices
-  Accessibility features implemented
- Code reviews and refactoring performed

###  Task 5: Deployment and Documentation
-  Backend deployed to Render
-  Frontend deployed to Vercel
-  CI/CD configured using GitHub Actions
-  Monitoring and error logging using console logs (extendable to Sentry)
-  This README serves as part of technical documentation

API Documentation
The backend exposes RESTful API routes for:

Endpoint	Method	Description
/api/users/register	POST	Register a new user
/api/users/login	POST	Login and get token
/api/menu	GET	Get all menu items
/api/menu	POST	Add a new menu item
/api/orders	POST	Create a new order

Protected routes require JWT in Authorization header.
